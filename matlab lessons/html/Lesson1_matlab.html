The first module lays the foundations for building computational skills. It is not meant to support a particular engineering course, so it can be used by freshman students. The context problems should be interesting to any science-minded student.</p><h2><b>Lesson 1 builds competency on these basic skills:</b><a name="2"></a></h2><div><ul><li>reading data from a file in comma-separated format (CSV)</li><li>plotting data</li><li>analyzing data with statistics</li><li>writing an image of a plot to a file</li></ul></div><h2><b>Context - Earth temperature over time</b><a name="3"></a></h2><p>Is global temperature rising? How much? This is a question of burning importance in today's world!</p><p>Data about global temperatures are available from several sources: NASA, the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and the University of East Anglia in the UK. Check out the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research <a href="https://www2.ucar.edu/climate/faq/how-much-has-global-temperature-risen-last-100-years">(UCAR)</a> for an in-depth discussion. The <a href="http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a003900/a003901/">NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</a> is one of our sources of global climate data. They produced this video showing a color map of the changing global surface temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2011.</p><p>The term <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/anomalies.php"><i>global temperature anomaly</i></a> means the difference in temperature with respect to a reference value or a long-term average. It is a very useful way of looking at the problem and in many ways better than absolute temperature. For example, a winter month may be colder than average in Washington DC, and also in Miami, but the absolute temperatures will be different in both places.</p><h2><b>Step 1: Read a data file</b><a name="6"></a></h2><p>The data is contained in the file:</p><p><i>GlobalTemperatureAnomaly-1958-2008.csv</i></p><p>with the year on the first column and 12 monthly averages of temperature anomaly listed sequentially on the second column. We will read the file, then make an initial plot to see what it looks like.</p><p>To load the file, we use a function called <i>csvread()</i>. This is how it works:</p><pre class="codeinput">csvread(<span class="string">'../resources/GlobalTemperatureAnomaly-1958-2008.csv'</span>);
</pre><p>Note that we called the function with only the file path. csvread works out the rest for us. It's important to note that this function will only work when used on purely numeric data.</p><p>As the output of the function, we get an array. It's rather big, and we probably don't want to look at it directly. As such, we've suppressed the output.  To do this, we add a semicolon to the end of the function call.  Later, we'll want to work with this data , so we'll assign it to the variable <i>T</i>.</p><pre class="codeinput">T=csvread(<span class="string">'../resources/GlobalTemperatureAnomaly-1958-2008.csv'</span>);
</pre><p>That's interesting. Now, we don't see any output from the function call. Why? We've added a semicolon to the end of the expression, which suppresses the output in MATLAB. To show the output, we can leave off the semicolon, type in the name of the variable, or use a display() command. We could also look at it in the array viewer.  To do this, find the variable name in the "Workspace" section of your MATLAB window, and double click it.  This lets us scroll through the data in an intuitive way to better visualize its significance. The screenshot below shows where you can find the array.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Array_viewer_workspace.png" alt=""> </p><p>Let's find out how big the array is. For that, we use a cool function called <i>size()</i>:</p><pre class="codeinput">size(T)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

   612     2

</pre><p>The array T holding our temperature data has two columns and 612 rows. Since we said we had monthly data, how many years is that?</p><pre class="codeinput">612/12
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
ans =

    51

</pre><p>That's right: from 1958 through 2008.</p><p>We'll be using these two columns of data a lot.  To reference a column of data, you can use the syntax array(:,column number).  The general scheme in matlab is that the first part, the :, references the rows.  Using a semicolon here means "all rows." The second part, the column number, selects a column.  Using the array viewer, we can see that the first column, 1, contains the year data, while the second column contains the anomalies. You can remember that it's rows, then columns by just thinking about RC, like remote control.  MATLAB is sort of like remote control for your computer, right?</p><p>Lets save our columns of data with variable names that make sense.</p><pre class="codeinput">Temp = T(:,2);
year = T(:,1);
</pre><h2><b>Step 2: Plot the data</b><a name="20"></a></h2><p>We will display the data in two ways: as a time series of the monthly temperature anomalies versus time, and as a histogram. To be fancy, we'll put both plots in one figure.</p><p>Plotting the time series of temperature is as easy as calling the function <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html"><i>plot()</i></a>. If we write <i>figure</i> above a call to plot, then we'll get a new figure, which is really nice if you have a lot of outputs you want to look at.</p><p>Remember the shape of T? It has two columns and the temperature values are in the second column. We extract the values of the second column by specifying 2 as the second index (the first column has index 1) and using the colon notation : to mean <i>all rows</i>. Check it out:</p><pre class="codeinput">figure
plot(Temp)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lesson1_matlab_01.png" alt=""> <p><i>Do you see a trend in the data?</i></p><p>The plot above is certainly useful, but wouldn't it be nicer if we could look at the data relative to the year, instead of the location of the data in the array?</p><p>The plot function can some more inputs; check out the link above to Mathwork's help document. If you ever want to know more about a function, try typing help(function) or doc(function).  You can also use the help interactively, or search the Mathwork's website.  Let's pretty our plot up a bit</p><pre class="codeinput">figure
plot(year,Temp)
title(<span class="string">'Temperature Anomaly 1958-2008'</span>)
xlabel(<span class="string">'Year'</span>)
ylabel(<span class="string">'Anomaly'</span>)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lesson1_matlab_02.png" alt=""> <p>The temperature anomaly certainly seems to show an increasing trend. But we're not going to stop there, of course. It's not that easy to convince people that the planet is warming, as you know.</p><p>Plotting a histogram, to show how often a the anomaly falls within some range function hist(). Why should it be any harder?</p><pre class="codeinput">figure
hist(Temp)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lesson1_matlab_03.png" alt=""> <p><i>What does this plot tell you about the data</i>? It's more interesting than just an increasing trend, that's for sure. You might want to look at more statistics now: mean, median, standard deviation. Use the help function to figure out how to do this.  You should get:</p><div><ul><li>mean of 0.0998</li><li>median of 0.0736</li><li>standard deviation of 0.2395</li></ul></div><p>You can control several parameters of the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hist.html"><i>hist()</i></a> plot. Learn more by reading the manual page (yes, you have to read the manual sometimes!). You can change a lot of the characteristics of the plot, like the color, the number of bins to look into, where those bins are located, and a lot of other things. To change the color of the bars, we need to do something a little trickier. Don't worry about the specifics just yet, we'll get there. Just know that this is a way to change the face color and background color of the histogram plot. To help you follow the flow here, we've added some comments. In MATLAB, these follow the % symbol. Try some other things out; it's really customizable.</p><pre class="codeinput">figure <span class="comment">%create a new figure</span>
[frequency,values]= hist(Temp); <span class="comment">%get histogram data from (T):,2))</span>
<span class="comment">%the above command saves the _frequency_, or how often, each "bin" in the</span>

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lesson1_matlab_04.png" alt=""> <p>This is fun. Finally, we'll put both plots on the same figure using the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/subplot.html"><i>subplot()</i></a> function, which creates a grid of plots. The arguments tell this function how many rows and columns of sub-plots we want, and where in the grid each plot will go.</p><p>To help you see what each plotting command is doing, we added comments, which in MATLAB follow the <b>%</b> symbol.</p><pre class="codeinput">figure <span class="comment">% create new figure</span>

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lesson1_matlab_05.png" alt=""> <h2><b>Step 3: Smooth the data and do regression</b><a name="32"></a></h2><p>You see a lot of fluctuations on the time series, so you might be asking yourself how to smooth it. No? Let's do it anyway.</p><p>One possible approach to smooth the data (there are others) is using a moving average, also known as a sliding-window average. This is defined as:</p><p><img src="Lesson1_matlab_eq33617.png" alt="$$\hat{x}_{i,n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{i-j}$$"></p><p>The only parameter to the moving average is the value <img src="Lesson1_matlab_eq25947.png" alt="$n$">. As you can see, the moving average smooths the set of data points by creating a new data set consisting of local averages (of the <img src="Lesson1_matlab_eq25947.png" alt="$n$"> previous data points) at each point in the new set.</p><p>A moving average is technically a <i>convolution</i>;Luckily, MATLAB has a built-in function for that, <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/filter.html">`filter()`</a> . We use it like this:</p><pre class="codeinput">figure
n = 12; <span class="comment">%window size of 12 months</span>
b = ones(1,n)/n; <span class="comment">%this is the 1/n part of our running average</span>
TMA = filter(b, 1, Temp); <span class="comment">% the filter command does a convolution for us</span>
plot(year,TMA,<span class="string">'color'</span>,<span class="string">'g'</span>) <span class="comment">%plot our convolution!</span>
title(<span class="string">'Running Average'</span>)
xlabel(<span class="string">'Year'</span>)
ylabel(<span class="string">'Anomaly'</span>)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lesson1_matlab_06.png" alt=""> <p>We use a <i>window</i> of 12 data points, meaning that the plot shows the average temperature over the last 12 months. Looking at the plot, we can still see a trend, but the range of values is smaller. Let's plot the original time series together with the smoothed version; you should edit the code below so that the plot of the Time Moving average is red with a linewidth of 3.  Use the help documentation to figure it out!</p><pre class="codeinput">figure
hold <span class="string">on</span> <span class="comment">%using the hold command lets us plot something new on the same plot</span>
plot(year,Temp,<span class="string">'color'</span>,<span class="string">'g'</span>)

ylabel(<span class="string">'Anomaly'</span>)
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Lesson1_matlab_07.png" alt=""> <p>That is interesting! The smoothed data follows the trend nicely but has much less noise. Well, that is what filtering data is all about.</p><p>Let's now fit a straight line through the temperature data, to see the trends. We would need to perform a least-squares linear regression to find the slope and intercept of a line</p><p><img src="Lesson1_matlab_eq16676.png" alt="$$y = mx+b$$"></p><p>that fits our data. Thankfully, MATLAB is here to help with the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyfit.html"><i>polyfit()</i></a> function. The function takes three arguments: the two array variables <img src="Lesson1_matlab_eq43551.png" alt="$x$"> and <img src="Lesson1_matlab_eq44020.png" alt="$y$">, and the order of the polynomial for the fit (in this case, 1 for linear regression).</p><pre class="codeinput">coefficients = polyfit(year,Temp,1); <span class="comment">%polyfit returns coefficients</span>

We say that there is <i>auto-correlation</i> in the data.</p><p>The problem with auto-correlation is that various techniques in statistical analysis rely on the assumption that scatter(or error) is random.  If you apply these techniques willy-nilly, you can get false trends, overestimate uncertaintis, or exaggerate the goodness of a fit. All bad things!</p><p>For the global temperature anomaly, this discussion is crucial: many critics claim that since there is auto-correlation in the data, no reliable trends can be obtained!</p><p>As a well-educated engineering student who cares about the planet, you will appreciate this: we <i>can</i> estimate the trend for the global temperature anomalies taking into account that the data points are not independent.</p><h2><b>Step 5: Generating useful output</b><a name="47"></a></h2><p>Unfortunately, many times, simply showing your code won't be enough; we'll need to have the code generate something more immediately useful.

%% *JIT Module 1, Lesson 1*
% This is lesson 1 of the first Just-in-Time (JIT) module for teaching 
% computing to engineers, in context. The first module lays the foundations 
% for building computational skills. It is not meant to support a particular
% engineering course, so it can be used by freshman students. The context 
% problems should be interesting to any science-minded student.

%% *Lesson 1 builds competency on these basic skills:*
%
% * reading data from a file in comma-separated format (CSV)
% * plotting data
% * analyzing data with statistics
% * writing an image of a plot to a file
%% *Context - Earth temperature over time*
% Is global temperature rising? How much? This is a question of burning importance in today's world!
%
%%
% Data about global temperatures are available from several sources: NASA, the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) 
% and the University of East 
% Anglia in the UK. Check out the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research 
% <https://www2.ucar.edu/climate/faq/how-much-has-global-temperature-risen-last-100-years (UCAR)>
% for an in-depth discussion.
% The 
% <http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a003900/a003901/ NASA Goddard Space Flight Center>
% is one of our sources of global climate data. They produced this video showing a 
% color map of the changing global surface temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2011.
%
%%
% The term 
% <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/anomalies.php _global temperature anomaly_>
% means the difference in temperature with respect to a reference value or a long-term average. 
% It is a very useful way of looking at the problem and in many ways better than absolute temperature. For example, a winter month may be 
% colder than average in Washington DC, and also in Miami, but the absolute temperatures will be different in both places.

%% *Step 1: Read a data file*
% The data is contained in the file:
%
%%
% _GlobalTemperatureAnomaly-1958-2008.csv_
% 
%%
% with the year on the first column and 12 monthly averages of temperature anomaly listed sequentially on the second column. We will read the file,
% then make an initial plot to see what it looks like.
%
%%
% To load the file, we use a function called _csvread()_. This is how it works:

%% 
csvread('../resources/GlobalTemperatureAnomaly-1958-2008.csv');

%% 
% Note that we called the function with only the file path. csvread works out the rest for us. It's important to note that this function
% will only work when used on purely numeric data.
%
%%
% As the output of the function, we get an array. It's rather big, and we
% probably don't want to look at it directly. As such, we've suppressed
% the output.  To do this, we add a semicolon to the end of the function call.  Later, we'll want to work with this data
% , so we'll assign it to the variable _T_.

T=csvread('../resources/GlobalTemperatureAnomaly-1958-2008.csv');

%%
% That's interesting. Now, we don't see any output from the function call. Why? We've added a semicolon to the end of the expression,
% which suppresses the output in MATLAB. To show the output, we can leave off the semicolon, type in the name of the variable, or use
% a display() command. We could also look at it in the array viewer.  To do this, find the variable name in the "Workspace" section of
% your MATLAB window, and double click it.  This lets us scroll through the data in an intuitive way to better visualize its significance.
% The screenshot below shows where you can find the array.

%%
% 
% <<Array_viewer_workspace.png>>

%%
% Let's find out how big the array is. For that, we use a cool function called _size()_:
% 
size(T)
%%
% The array T holding our temperature data has two columns and 612 rows. Since we said we had monthly data, how many years is that?

612/12

%% 
% That's right: from 1958 through 2008.

%%
% We'll be using these two columns of data a lot.  To reference a column of
% data, you can use the syntax array(:,column number).  The general scheme
% in matlab is that the first part, the :, references the rows.  Using a
% semicolon here means "all rows." The second part, the column number,
% selects a column.  Using the array viewer, we can see that the first
% column, 1, contains the year data, while the second column contains the
% anomalies. You can remember that it's rows, then columns by just thinking about RC,
% like remote control.  MATLAB is sort of like remote control for your computer, right?
%
%%
% Lets save our columns of data with variable names that make sense.

Temp = T(:,2);
year = T(:,1);

%% *Step 2: Plot the data*
% We will display the data in two ways: as a time series of the monthly temperature anomalies versus time, and as a histogram. 
% To be fancy, we'll put both plots in one figure.
%
%%
% Plotting the time series of temperature is as easy as calling the function
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/plot.html _plot()_>. 
% If we write _figure_ above a call to plot, then 
% we'll get a new figure, which is really nice if you have a lot of outputs you want to look at.
%
%%
% Remember the shape of T? It has two columns and the temperature values are in the second column.
% We extract the values of the second column by specifying 2 as the second index (the first column has index 1)
% and using the colon notation : to mean _all rows_. Check it out:
figure
plot(Temp)
%%
% _Do you see a trend in the data?_
%
%%
% The plot above is certainly useful, but wouldn't it be nicer if we could look at the data relative 
% to the year, instead of the location of the data in the array?
%
%%
% The plot function can some more inputs; check out the link above to Mathwork's help document.
% If you ever want to know more about a function, try typing help(function) or doc(function).  You can 
% also use the help interactively, or search the Mathwork's website.  Let's
% pretty our plot up a bit

figure
plot(year,Temp)
title('Temperature Anomaly 1958-2008')
xlabel('Year')
ylabel('Anomaly')

%%
% The temperature anomaly certainly seems to show an increasing trend. But we're not going to stop there, of course. 
% It's not that easy to convince people that the planet is warming, as you know.
%
%%
% Plotting a histogram, to show how often a the anomaly falls within some range
% function hist(). Why should it be any harder?

figure
hist(Temp)
%%
% _What does this plot tell you about the data_? It's more interesting than just an increasing trend, 
% that's for sure. You might want to look at more statistics now: mean,
% median, standard deviation. Use the help function to figure out how to do
% this.  You should get:
% 
% * mean of 0.0998
% * median of 0.0736
% * standard deviation of 0.2395

%%
% You can control several parameters of the 
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/hist.html _hist()_>
% plot. Learn more by reading the manual page (yes, you have to read the manual sometimes!).
% You can change a lot of the characteristics of the plot, like the color, the number of bins to 
% look into, where those bins are located, and a lot of other things. To change the color of the bars, 
% we need to do something a little trickier. Don't worry about the specifics just yet, we'll get there. 
% Just know that this is a way to change the face color and background color of the histogram plot. 
% To help you follow the flow here, we've added some comments. In MATLAB, these follow the % symbol.
% Try some other things out; it's really customizable.
figure %create a new figure
[frequency,values]= hist(Temp); %get histogram data from (T):,2))
%the above command saves the _frequency_, or how often, each "bin" in the
%histogram matches the data.  "The values" array saves the actual locations
%of the bins.
bar(values, frequency,'FaceColor','g','EdgeColor','w') %create a bar plot
%The bar plot above replaces the original histogram we used, because it is
%a lot easier to change colors and, generally, make the plot nicer looking.
%We use the values and frequency arrays we made with the hist function as
%the data for the plot.
title('Anomaly Histogram')
xlabel('Anomaly')
ylabel('Frequency')
%%
% This is fun. Finally, we'll put both plots on the same figure using the 
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/subplot.html _subplot()_> 
% function, which creates a grid of plots. The arguments 
% tell this function how many rows and columns of sub-plots we want, and
% where in the grid each plot will go.
%
%%
% To help you see what each plotting command is doing, we added comments, which in MATLAB follow the *%* symbol.

figure % create new figure
subplot(1,2,1) %activate first subplot, a 1x2 selection
plot(year,Temp,'color','g')%plot the lineplot in green

bar(values, frequency,'FaceColor','g','EdgeColor','w')%create a bar plot
title('Anomaly Histogram')
xlabel('Anomaly')
ylabel('Frequency')

%% *Step 3: Smooth the data and do regression*
% You see a lot of fluctuations on the time series, so you might be asking yourself how 
% to smooth it. No? Let's do it anyway.
%
%%
% One possible approach to smooth the data (there are others) is using a moving average, also known as a 
% sliding-window average. 
% This is defined as:
%
%%
% $$\hat{x}_{i,n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{i-j}$$
%
%%
% The only parameter to the moving average is the value $n$. As you can see, the moving average 
% smooths the set of data points by creating a new data set consisting of local averages 
% (of the $n$ previous data points) at each point in the new set.
%
%%
% A moving average is technically a _convolution_;Luckily, MATLAB has a built-in function for that,  
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/filter.html `filter()`>
% . We use it like this:

figure
n = 12; %window size of 12 months
b = ones(1,n)/n; %this is the 1/n part of our running average
TMA = filter(b, 1, Temp); % the filter command does a convolution for us
plot(year,TMA,'color','g') %plot our convolution!
title('Running Average')
xlabel('Year')
ylabel('Anomaly')

%%
% We use a _window_ of 12 data points, meaning that the plot shows the average temperature over the last 12 months. 
% Looking at the plot, we can still see a trend, but the range of values is smaller.
% Let's plot the original time series together with the smoothed version;
% you should edit the code below so that the plot of the Time Moving
% average is red with a linewidth of 3.  Use the help documentation to
% figure it out! 

figure
hold on %using the hold command lets us plot something new on the same plot
plot(year,Temp,'color','g')
plot(year,TMA,'color','g')
title('Temperature Anomaly with Running Average')
xlabel('Year')
ylabel('Anomaly')

%%
% That is interesting! The smoothed data follows the trend nicely but has 
% much less noise. Well, that is what filtering data is all about.
%
%%
% Let's now fit a straight line through the temperature data, to see the 
% trends. We would need to perform a least-squares linear regression to 
% find the slope and intercept of a line
%
%%
% $$y = mx+b$$
%
%%
% that fits our data. Thankfully, MATLAB is here to help with the
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/polyfit.html _polyfit()_>
% function. The function takes three arguments: the two array 
% variables $x$ and $y$, and the order of the polynomial for the fit 
% (in this case, 1 for linear regression).

coefficients = polyfit(year,Temp,1); %polyfit returns coefficients
figure 
hold on %we'll be using more than one plot
plot(year,Temp,'color','g');
plot(year,polyval(coefficients,year),'REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH','linewidth',2);
% the polyval function takes an array of coefficients(from polyfit, in our
% case), and a number of x-values to create the y-values of the function
% described by those coefficients.  use the doc command to find out more.
title('Temperature Anomaly Fit Line')
xlabel('Year')
ylabel('Anomaly')
axis([1958 2008 -.6 .8]) %this changes the axes of our plot to frame the data

%% *Step 4: Correcting for auto correlation*
% We won't go into details, but you will learn more about all this if you
% take a course on experimental methods REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHfor example, at GW, the
% Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department offers "_Methods of
% Engineering Experimentation_"(MAE-3120).
%
%%
% The fact is that in *time series* (like global temperatures, stock
% values, etc.), the fluctuations in the data are not random: adjacent data
% points are not independent.  We say that there is _auto-correlation_ in
% the data.
%
%%
% The problem with auto-correlation is that various techniques in
% statistical analysis rely on the assumption that scatter(or error) is
% random.  If you apply these techniques willy-nilly, you can get false
% trends, overestimate uncertaintis, or exaggerate the goodness of a fit.
% All bad things!
%
%%
% For the global temperature anomaly, this discussion is crucial: many
% critics claim that since there is auto-correlation in the data, no
% reliable trends can be obtained!
%
%%
% As a well-educated engineering student who cares about the planet, you
% will appreciate this: we _can_ estimate the trend for the global
% temperature anomalies taking into account that the data points are not
% independent.

%% *Step 5: Generating useful output*
% Unfortunately, many times, simply showing your code won't be enough;
% we'll need to have the code generate something more immediately useful.
% Here, we'll use our linear fit curve to project the temperature in the
% future.  We'll also save some image files that we could, potentially,
% drop into a document or report based on our findings. First, let's create
% an expectation of the temperature anomaly up to the year 2100.

spacing = (2008-1958)/612;
length = (2100-1958)/spacing;
length = int8(length); %ensure length is an integer for the linear spacing
years = linspace(1958,2100,length);
est = polyval(coefficients,years);
figure
plot(years,est,'REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH','linewidth',2)
title('Temperature Estimate')
xlabel('Year')
ylabel('Anomaly')
axis([1958, 2100,-.5 ,2])
out = [years;est].';%transpose the matrix to match our input file
% we need to transpose the matrix because, by default, the data was saved
% in rows.  The data that we originally imported was in columns, so we're
% going to match that format.

%%
% Ok, that estimation looks reasonable.  Let's save the x and y values of a 
% the estimation that we just created.
csvwrite('../resources/GlobalTemperatureEstimate-1958-2100.csv', out)
%%
% Now, lets make a nicer picture that we can show to back up some of our 
% information. We can plot the linear regression as well as the original 
% data and then save it as an image.
outplot = figure; % we need to be able to reference our figure!
%Here, we're naming our figure to the name outplot so we can tell the
%computer what to save.
hold on
plot(year,Temp,'color','g');
plot(years,est,'REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH','linewidth',2);
title('Temperature Anomaly and Prediction')
xlabel('Year')
ylabel('Anomaly')
print(outplot,'../resources/GlobalTempPlot.png') %this statement saves a picture
%The first argument here, "outplot" tells the code what variable to save:
%our picture, while the second argument is the relative file path to save
%to.

%%
% Nice! Now weve got some stuff that we could use in a report, or show to
% someone unfamiliar with coding.  Remember to play with the code above;
% I'm sure you could get some really nice plots with a little bit more
% effort!

%% _Dig Deeper & Think_
%
% # How is the global temperature anomaly calculated?
% # What does it mean and why is it employed instead of the global mean
% temperature to quantify global warming?
% # Why is it important to check that the residuals are independent and
% random when performing linear regression?
% # In this particular case, is it possible to still estimate a trend with
% confidence?
% # What is your best estimate of the global temperature by the end of the
% 22nd century?

%% _What did we learn?_
% You should have played around with the code in this document as you write
% your own version of the code in a seperate matlab script to learn:

% * how to read data from a comma-seperated value file
% * how to plot data
